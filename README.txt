INTRODUCTION
The Kataegis program provide a convenient tool to define the Kataegis region in 
cancer samples. The name Kataegis is a greek word meaning storm, which is a vivid 
metaphor for the hypermutations occur in cancer genomes. Researchers have found 
that this phenomena found in the breast and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), more 
and more reseaches report this phenomena in other types of cancers as well. There 
were evidences showed that the kataegis, which is induced by AID/APOBEC cytosine 
deaminase, is related to the proganosis, and the possible treatment strategies 
decision. Thus, the package can meet the needs of a light-weighted and simple-to-use 
toolkit for quick identifying and visualizing the kataegis of the genomes.
